# **heap (Priority Queue)**
---
- Structure - **Complete Binary Tree**
  - Every level is complete except may be the last level. All nodes of the last level as left as possible.
- Types of heaps:
  - Min heap --> For all nodes, **node.data <= children data**
  - Max heap --> For all node, **node.data >= children data**
- No relationship between left and right subtree.
- Due to complete binary tree structure, we also can use array to store data instead of using left and right pointers. (Level Order Traversal)
  - For all nodes, left child = 2n+1
  - For all nodes, right child = 2n+2
  - parent = (i-1)/2 (Array this is possible) --> Array is good choice
- Insertion in the heap
  - **Heapify** --> Maintain properties of heap after any operations
  - Bottom Up movements
  - TC = O(logn)
- getMin() in the heap (min heap)
  - Top Down movements
- Searching Element in the heap
  - heap is not good for searching operation because left and right subtree do not have any relationship.So we need to parse entire tree.
  - Time Complexity TC = O(N)
  - Use HashMap, HashSet or Binary Search Tree
- Build Min heap
  - Insert all element one by one --> TC = O(nlogn)
  - If all the element are known
    - Number of leaves nodes in complete binary tree = (n+1)/2
      - means half nodes of complete binary tree is leaf nodes.
    - Bottom up Approach --> TC = O(n)
    - Inplace heap Build
      - TC = O(n), SC = O(1)
